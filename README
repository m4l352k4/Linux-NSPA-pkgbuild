This repo contains my linux kernel packages based on Linux-CachyOS sources.

Original source and project can be found here;

https://github.com/CachyOS/linux-cachyo

I add some misc patches for my own purposes.

NOTE: I remove downloading the patches from the original source and instead
I include the patches in the packages -- as to not rely on external github 
sources that may disappear, at some point.

I remove ${_patchsource} from the pkgbuild after downloading
all patches. Then i run updpkgums and finally, I create the source package.

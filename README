This repo contains my linux kernel packages based on Linux-CachyOS sources.

I add some misc patches for my own purposes. I include a threadsirq and other fixup for
amd-pinctrl / i2c related drivers, some misc wine-related stuff, etc.

As well, I have packages for both vanilla and PREEMPT_RT kernels for Archlinux.

NOTE: the kernel configs are my local configs, specifically for my machine. If
anyone is using these packages, you will have to generate your own config - as
mine are 'make localmodconfig'd, as i use modprobed-db;

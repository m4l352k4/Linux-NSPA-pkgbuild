Subject: [PATCH 09/13] ZEN: mm: Disable watermark boosting by default

What watermark boosting does is preemptively fire up kswapd to free
memory when there hasn't been an allocation failure. It does this by
increasing kswapd's high watermark goal and then firing up kswapd. The
reason why this causes freezes is because, with the increased high
watermark goal, kswapd will steal memory from processes that need it in
order to make forward progress. These processes will, in turn, try to
allocate memory again, which will cause kswapd to steal necessary pages
from those processes again, in a positive feedback loop known as page
thrashing. When page thrashing occurs, your system is essentially
livelocked until the necessary forward progress can be made to stop
processes from trying to continuously allocate memory and trigger
kswapd to steal it back.

This problem already occurs with kswapd *without* watermark boosting,
but it's usually only encountered on machines with a small amount of
memory and/or a slow CPU. Watermark boosting just makes the existing
problem worse enough to notice on higher spec'd machines.

Disable watermark boosting by default since it's a total dumpster fire.
I can't imagine why anyone would want to explicitly enable it, but the
option is there in case someone does.

Contains:
  - mm: Stop kswapd early when nothing's waiting for it to free pages

    Keeping kswapd running when all the failed allocations that invoked it
    are satisfied incurs a high overhead due to unnecessary page eviction
    and writeback, as well as spurious VM pressure events to various
    registered shrinkers. When kswapd doesn't need to work to make an
    allocation succeed anymore, stop it prematurely to save resources.

  - mm: Don't stop kswapd on a per-node basis when there are no waiters

    The page allocator wakes all kswapds in an allocation context's allowed
    nodemask in the slow path, so it doesn't make sense to have the kswapd-
    waiter count per each NUMA node. Instead, it should be a global counter
    to stop all kswapds when there are no failed allocation requests.

Subject: [PATCH 11/13] ZEN: mm: Increment kswapd_waiters for throttled direct
 reclaimers

Throttled direct reclaimers will wake up kswapd and wait for kswapd to
satisfy their page allocation request, even when the failed allocation
lacks the __GFP_KSWAPD_RECLAIM flag in its gfp mask. As a result, kswapd
may think that there are no waiters and thus exit prematurely, causing
throttled direct reclaimers lacking __GFP_KSWAPD_RECLAIM to stall on
waiting for kswapd to wake them up. Incrementing the kswapd_waiters
counter when such direct reclaimers become throttled fixes the problem.

Subject: [PATCH 12/13] ZEN: mm: Don't hog the CPU and zone lock in
 rmqueue_bulk()

There is noticeable scheduling latency and heavy zone lock contention
stemming from rmqueue_bulk's single hold of the zone lock while doing
its work, as seen with the preemptoff tracer. There's no actual need for
rmqueue_bulk() to hold the zone lock the entire time; it only does so
for supposed efficiency. As such, we can relax the zone lock and even
reschedule when IRQs are enabled in order to keep the scheduling delays
and zone lock contention at bay. Forward progress is still guaranteed,
as the zone lock can only be relaxed after page removal.

With this change, rmqueue_bulk() no longer appears as a serious offender
in the preemptoff tracer, and system latency is noticeably improved.
